## *[Space API](https://jamesg95.github.io/SpaceApi/ "Space Api")*

 The **Space API** is an application that outputs information based on user input. The app runs through 3 different APIs. The APIs used are: 

* [The Solar System OpenData](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/ "The Solar System OpenData")
* [The GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ "The GIPHY API")
* [The YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/ "The YouTube API")

When the app loads, the user is able to search a planet, star, or moon. If the search term is found in the APIs, the app will output 3 items.

* Information based on what was searched.
* A GIF related to what was searched.
* Six YouTube videos related to what was searched. 

At the bottom of the page, the app tells the user that they can *"Search Again"*.

This brings the user back to the top of the page to search again.
